        <p><u>BORN THIS WAY by LADY GAGA</u></p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M</p>
<p>Just put your paws up</p>
<p>'Cause you were born this way, baby</p>
<p>My mama told me when I was young, "We are all born superstars"</p>
<p>She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on in the glass of her boudoir</p>
<p>"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"</p>
<p>She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe</p>
<p>So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far"</p>
<p>Listen to me when I say</p>
<p>I'm beautiful in my way 'cause God makes no mistakes</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>Don't hide yourself in regret, just love yourself, and you're set</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way (born this way)</p>
<p>Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>Baby, I was born this way (born this way)</p>
<p>Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>Right track, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>Don't be a drag, just be a queen</p>
<p>Don't be a drag, just be a queen</p>
<p>Don't be a drag, just be a queen</p>
<p>Don't be (don't be, don't be)</p>
<p>Give yourself prudence and love your friends</p>
<p>Subway kid, rejoice your truth</p>
<p>In the religion of the insecure, I must be myself, respect my youth</p>
<p>A different lover is not a sin, believe capital H-I-M (hey, hey, hey)</p>
<p>I love my life, I love this record, and</p>
<p>Mi amore vole fe, yah (same DNA)</p>
<p>I'm beautiful in my way 'cause God makes no mistakes</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>Don't hide yourself in regret, just love yourself, and you're set</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>Baby, I was born this way (born this way)</p>
<p>Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>Don't be a drag, just be a queen</p>
<p>Whether you're broke or evergreen</p>
<p>You're Black, white, beige, chola descent</p>
<p>You're Lebanese, you're Orient'</p>
<p>Whether life's disabilities left you outcast, bullied, or teased</p>
<p>Rejoice and love yourself today</p>
<p>'Cause, baby, you were born this way</p>
<p>No matter gay, straight, or bi', lesbian, transgender life</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born to survive</p>
<p>No matter Black, white or beige, chola, or Orient' made</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born to be brave</p>
<p>I'm beautiful in my way 'cause God makes no mistakes</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>Don't hide yourself in regret, just love yourself, and you're set</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way, yeah</p>
<p>Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>Baby, I was born this way (born this way)</p>
<p>Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way</p>
<p>I was born this way, hey</p>
<p>I was born this way, hey</p>
<p>I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way, hey</p>
